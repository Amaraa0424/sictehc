Product Requirements Document (PRD)

Project Name: UniConnectDate: July 5, 2025Author: Product Team

1. Purpose & Vision

Purpose: Create a real-time social media platform tailored for university students to share research, academic papers, and collaborate within campus clubs.Vision Statement: Enable students to seamlessly discover scholarly content, network through clubs, and communicate instantly without page reloads—fostering an engaged academic community.

2. Background & Context

Existing platforms (Facebook, LinkedIn) aren’t optimized for scholarly collaboration.

Campus clubs lack centralized, real-time communication hubs.

Students demand instant updates (likes, comments, messages) to stay engaged.

3. Goals & Success Metrics

Primary Goals:

Achieve 70% active daily engagement on academic posts within 3 months of launch.

Ensure 100% of clubs have an active page with at least one real-time chat channel.

Maintain <200ms latency for real-time updates (chat, feed activities).

Key Metrics:

Daily Active Users (DAU) / Monthly Active Users (MAU) ratio

Average session duration

Number of papers shared and downloaded

Real-time event latency (chat message delivery, feed update propagation)

4. Target Audience

Undergraduate and graduate students at universities.

Academic clubs and societies (e.g., Robotics Club, Debate Society).

Student researchers publishing and reviewing papers.

5. Feature Overview

5.1 Academic Feed

Post research summaries and full-text academic papers.

Support rich media (PDF embeds, images, videos).

Like, comment, repost.

Real-time feed updates (new posts, comments) via WebSockets or similar.

5.2 Club Pages

Create/manage club pages that function like mini-communities.

Admin roles: President, Secretary, Member.

Post announcements, events, resources.

Real-time update stream for each club page.

5.3 Chat

1-on-1 Chat: Real-time private messaging.

Group Chat: Create custom groups (e.g., study groups, project teams).

Multimedia messaging: text, file attachments (PDFs, images).

Presence indicators (online/offline).

Read receipts and typing indicators.

5.4 Notifications

Real-time push notifications for mentions, messages, club announcements.

In-app notification center.

Email fallback for critical alerts.

5.5 Search & Discovery

Search research posts by title, author, keywords.

Discover clubs by category (Engineering, Arts, Science).

Follow tags and topics; personalized feed.

5.6 Profiles & Roles

Student profiles with academic info (major, year, publications).

Club roles and permissions.

Privacy settings (public vs. private profile, paper visibility).

Backend: Node.js with NestJS or Express; WebSocket server (Socket.IO or native).

Database: PostgreSQL for relational data; Redis for pub/sub and caching.

File Storage: AWS S3 for paper uploads.

CI/CD: Automated pipelines with tests and canary deployments.

9. User Flows & Wireframes**

(Include sketches or links to Figma prototypes for feed, chat, club page creation.)
